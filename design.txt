get_product_historic_rates for all currencies over x period of time to calculate average --do this later

for each currency?
get_orders (pass "done" ) and get most recent done order (maybe know this beforehand?)
get current spot price with either get_product_trades (latest trades) or get_product_ticker (latest offers)

decide whether or not to buy or sell (this is the heart of it) v1 do this for each currency
    find percentage change from last sale
    if it's up x% check with me about selling:
          if I say yes, sell
    if it's down x%, check with me about buying:
          if I say yes:
              scrape off all the profits and buy with the rest (right now buy amount is constant and we scrape profits)

^^this is pretty naive b/c it only focuses on profits

O's suggestion:
if it's dropped 10%:
     start counting the drop and wait till it has risen back up 2 percent
     this could look like a running tally of the derivative, and when derivative changes from positive to negative, wait for a 2% change the other direction

same if it's going up

other option would just be to say fuck it, this $2000 can be thrown away, and go all in every time

a better version of this would compare across the three currencies, and would say:
  ok so bitcoin is down 5% AND ethereum is up 10% so if I sell between the two I'll win.
  always looking for a 10% spread or something similar
