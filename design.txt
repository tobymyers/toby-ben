get_product_historic_rates for all currencies over x period of time to calculate average --do this later

for each currency?
get_orders (pass "done" ) and get most recent done order (maybe know this beforehand?)
get current spot price with either get_product_trades (latest trades) or get_product_ticker (latest offers)

decide whether or not to buy or sell (this is the heart of it) v1 do this for each currency
    find percentage change from last sale
    if it's up x% check with me about selling:
          if I say yes, sell
    if it's down x%, check with me about buying:
          if I say yes:
              scrape off all the profits and buy with the rest (right now buy amount is constant and we scrape profits)

^^this is pretty naive b/c it only focuses on profits

O's suggestion:
if it's dropped 10%:
     start counting the drop and wait till it has risen back up 2 percent
     this could look like a running tally of the derivative, and when derivative changes from positive to negative, wait for a 2% change the other direction

same if it's going up

other option would just be to say fuck it, this $2000 can be thrown away, and go all in every time

a better version of this would compare across the three currencies, and would say:
  ok so bitcoin is down 5% AND ethereum is up 10% so if I sell between the two I'll win.
  always looking for a 10% spread or something similar


Ben's model idea:


every five seconds record price and divide by last recorded price,
keep a running tally of percentage change since last peak

price at last transaction
was it a buy or a sell

if it drops more than x %:  #gotta figure out how to round it
    record price 1
    wait 5 seconds
    record price 2 and divide p1/p2 as %change
    if %change > 1, wait because it's still dropping
    if %change = 1 it's an inflection point
    if %change is < 1 we suspect it's going back up, so we buy
        optional: count up number of times it's less than 1:
        if it's > 1 for more than 4 cycles, buy




    store %change1

    loop through this


    if p1/p2 -  p2/p3 <= 0:
        do nothing
    if p1/p2 > 0:


#good stuff from Zack.  High level class running all the time is do_the_things (see below)

#mid level extensions of classes e.g high_risk_strategy, low_risk_strategy, mid_risk_strategy that extend a low level class called base_strategy,
so they each have their own internal logic but the same exact __init__ params.

e.g.Class high_risk_strategy:
          buy at 10%
          sell at 2% down




do_the_things(method, other stuff)
    object = methodx
    object.buy
    object.sell
